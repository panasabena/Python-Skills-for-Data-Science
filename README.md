# Python-Skills-for-Data-Science
Python for Data Science Essential Training is one of the most popular data science courses at LinkedIn Learning. 
It has now been updated and expanded to two partsâ€”for even more hands-on experience with Python. 
In this course, instructor Lillian Pierson takes you step by step through a practical data science project: 
a web scraper that downloads and analyzes data from the web. 
Along the way, she introduces techniques to clean, reformat, transform, and describe raw data; generate visualizations; 
remove outliers; perform simple data analysis; and generate interactive graphs using the Plotly library. 
You should walk away from this training with basic coding experience that you can take to your organization and quickly apply to your own custom data science projects.

# Advance Python Skills for Data Science

In this course, instructor Lillian Pierson takes you step by step through a practical data science project: building machine learning models that can generate predictions and recommendations and automate routine tasks. Along the way, she shows how to perform linear and logistic regression, use K-means and hierarchal clustering, identify relationships between variables, and use other machine learning tools such as neural networks and Bayesian models. You should walk away from this training with hands-on coding experience that you can quickly apply to your own data science projects.
